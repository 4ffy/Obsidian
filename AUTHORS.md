## NOTES:

OBLIGE was written from scratch. It does not contain any code
from SLIGE (by David Chess) or from any other random level
generator. That being said, OBSIDIAN has since integrated the SLUMP
level generator, a GPL2 fork of David Chess' SLIGE that was created
by Sam Trenholme.

Part of the cave algorithm used in OBSIDIAN was described by Jim
Babcock in his article: "Cellular Automata Method for Generating
Random Cave-Like Levels".

The internal font loading code is derived from a post by Ian MacArthur
in a Google Groups thread at the following link:
https://groups.google.com/g/fltkgeneral/c/uAdg8wOLiMk

OBSIDIAN uses Lua 5.4.x (http://www.lua.org)

OBSIDIAN uses FLTK 1.3.x (http://www.fltk.org)
